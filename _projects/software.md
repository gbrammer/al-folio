Nearly everything I do is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/gbrammer).

-----------

Space telescope data analysis
=============================

[`grizli`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/grizli) - Comprehensive software 
pipeline for analyzing space-based imaging and slitless spectroscopy observations.

[`golfir`](https://github.com/gbrammer/golfir) - Make *Spitzer* IRAC and MIPS mosaics that work well with `grizli` *Hubble* images.

[`mastquery`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/mastquery) - Python tools for querying the MAST HST database.  Some tools also for *Spitzer* in [`mastquery.overlaps.spitzer_query`](https://github.com/gbrammer/mastquery/blob/master/mastquery/overlaps.py#L1086).

[`tristars`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/tristars) - Asterism matching for astrometric alignment.

[`reprocess_wfc3`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/reprocess_wfc3) - Tools for reprocessing WFC3/IR observations that suffer from strong time-variable backgrounds.

[`wfc3dash`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/wfc3dash) - Helper scripts for WFC3 DASH observations (that can subsequently be processed with `grizli`).

----------

Photometric redshifts
=====================

[`eazy`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/eazy-photoz) - Photometric redshift software from [Brammer, van Dokkum, & Coppi (2008)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...686.1503B).

[`eazy-py`](https://www.github.com/gbrammer/eazy-py) - Complete rewrite of `eazy` in Python (recommended).
